# titanic
The project was made to proof my learnings in Machine Learning Regression for Apple Developer Academy UFPE.
This project uses the Titanic dataset, which is used by many people all over the world.
It provides information on the fate of passengers on the Titanic, summarized according to economic status (class), sex, age and survival.
In this challenge, we are asked to predict whether a passenger on the titanic would have been survived or not.
